## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety and performance. Understanding how the Rust compiler works is essential for developers who want to write efficient and safe Rust code. This repository aims to provide resources and insights into the Rust compiler, including its architecture and pipeline.

## What You Will Learn

In this deep dive, you will learn:

- The overall architecture of the Rust compiler.
- How the compiler processes code through various stages.
- The role of different components like the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Intermediate Representation (IR), and LLVM.
- How Cargo, Rust's package manager, interacts with the compiler.
- Practical insights into optimizing Rust code.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following key topics:

- **AST**: Understand how the compiler represents code in a tree structure.
- **Cargo**: Learn about Rust's package manager and its role in the compilation process.
- **CFG**: Explore Control Flow Graphs and their importance in optimization.
- **Compiler Pipeline**: Get an overview of the steps involved in compiling Rust code.
- **IR**: Delve into Intermediate Representation and its significance.
- **LLVM**: Discover how LLVM optimizes Rust code for various architectures.
- **MIR**: Learn about the Mid-level Intermediate Representation and its role in the compilation.
- **Rustc**: Understand the Rust compiler and its features.
- **Solidity & Vyper**: Briefly touch on how Rust compares with other programming languages in the blockchain space.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DHARANIVENDHANV/rust_compiler_deep_dive.git
   cd rust_compiler_deep_dive
   ```

2. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/DHARANIVENDHANV/rust_compiler_deep_dive/releases) section for downloadable files and execute them to gain insights into the Rust compiler.

## Installation

To install the necessary tools for working with Rust, follow these instructions:

1. Install Rust using rustup:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Ensure you have the latest version:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   ```

3. Install Cargo if it is not included:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo
   ```

4. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

## Usage

After installing Rust and cloning the repository, you can start exploring the compiler:

1. Open the source files in your favorite text editor.
2. Run the following command to compile a sample Rust program:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. Dive into the specific components of the Rust compiler by examining the code and documentation provided in this repository.
